      <h1>Welcome to the Let's Do Digital Clinic</h1>
      <p>
        Welcome to <strong>Let's Do Digital Clinic!</strong> While the name
        might suggest a traditional healthcare facility, we are not a real
        clinic. Instead, this is a website that is built by healthcare
        proffesionals, <i>especially</i>
        doctors, who are looking to learn front end engineering
      </p>
      <p>
        At Let's Do Digital Clinic, we understand that
        <b>technology is playing an increasingly important role in healthcare</b
        >. From telemedicine to electronic health records, the ability to
        understand and navigate digital tools is becoming
        <em>just as essential as clinical expertise</em>. However, many doctors
        and healthcare workers are not formally trained in coding.
      </p>
      <p>
        By building this website, clinicians will get hands on experience in the
        crafting of the basic building blocks of front end development, creating
        a foundation that will allow them to expand forwards.
