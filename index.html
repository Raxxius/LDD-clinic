      <h1>Welcome to the Let's Do Digital Clinic</h1>
      <p>
        Welcome to Let's Do Digital Clinic! While the name might suggest a
        traditional healthcare facility, we are not a real clinic. Instead, this
        is a website that is built by healthcare proffesionals, especially
        doctors, who are looking to learn front end engineering
      </p>

      <p>
        At Let's Do Digital Clinic, we understand that technology is playing an
        increasingly important role in healthcare. From telemedicine to
        electronic health records, the ability to understand and navigate
        digital tools is becoming just as essential as clinical expertise.
        However, many doctors and healthcare workers are not formally trained in
        coding.
      </p>

      <p>
        By building this website, clinicians will get hands on experience in the
        crafting of the basic building blocks of front end development, creating
        a foundation that will allow them to expand forwards.
